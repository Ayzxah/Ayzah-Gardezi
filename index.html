<h1>Hi!</h1>
<p>Thanks for stopping by!
    I'm Ayzah, very kind of you to have a look at my website.
    In case you're interested in knowing a bit about me, I'm a computer engineering student studying at GIKI.
    I'm from Karachi, and this is the first time I'm living on my own (and I'm nailing it for sure ;))
</p>

<h2>A look at my extracurriculars and achievements!</h2>

<p>    •	Member of the school’s literary society, 2017-2018.</p>
<p>    •	Promoted to president, 2018.</p>
<p>    •	Organised poetry elocution contests, 2018 and 2019. For which I prepared several students, some being society members, and others not, teaching them the requirements of elocutions, </p>
<p>i.e. the tones, expressions and dialect, and how to improve vocal fluency in delivery.</p>
<p>    •	Conducted a story-writing competition, involving three levels, and providing each with multiple choices in topics.</p>
